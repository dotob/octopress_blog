man that was easy. after my [problems](http://www.batteryslave.com/2009/10/getting-ruby-on-rails-to-run-on-my-debian-4-vps/) with getting ruby, gem and rails to run installing mod_rails aka phusion passenger was really easy:- gem install passenger
- passenger-install-apache2-module
i followed the steps that the installer told me and go. just needed to apt-get some apache dev packages and was ready to run. cant tell you how happy i am.now the rails fun can start.
