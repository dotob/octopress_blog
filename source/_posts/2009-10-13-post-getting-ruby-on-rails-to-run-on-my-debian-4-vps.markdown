man...always fighting to get a recent version of anything to run on the debian 4 (etch) vps i have. this time: ruby on rails. ruby v1.9.1, gems 1.3.5 and ror 2.3.4 is what i had i mind. 

first step: download ruby. execute the usual ./configure && make && make install triplet. worked fine. then download ruby gems. but when i tried to run anything with gem i got:

``` 
/usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require': no such file to load -- zlib (LoadError)
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `require'
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/spec_fetcher.rb:1
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require'
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `require'
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/commands/update_command.rb:5
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require'
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `require'
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/command_manager.rb:167:in `load_and_instantiate'
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/command_manager.rb:88:in `[]'
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/command_manager.rb:144:in `find_command'
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/command_manager.rb:131:in `process_args'
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/command_manager.rb:102:in `run'
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/gem_runner.rb:58:in `run'
	from /usr/local/bin/gem:21
```

after googleing and trying some stuff i solved it this way:
- edit ruby-1.9.1-p0/ext/Setup
- uncomment the line zlib
- make && make install again

next step. successfully let gem install rails. but then ``ruby script/server`` stopped with:

```

	from script/server:3:in `require'
	from script/server:3:in 
```

after a another round i found [this site](http://linuxnuggetz.blogspot.com/2009/06/ruby-on-rail-on-ubuntu.html) with help:
- apt-get install openssl libssl-dev
- apt-get install ruby1.9-dev
- cd ruby-1.9.1-p129/ext/openssl
- ruby extconf.rb
- make && make install

that worked. nice. so now i am waiting for the next fail
