after that we got a lunchbag and sat in the sun for an hour. then sebastien lambla joined. i didnt know much about him but he seemed funny and interesting so i decided to see his talk instead of the fitnesse one. and it was great. he stated that he had only 3h of sleep because he had to get openrasta to work for the workshop. but he got it and the workshop went great.when the workshop ended we all went to have a beer. there where some discussions with lambla aka serialseb, oren aka ayende and some other nice guys.we ended the evening with pizza at pizza express with 14 funny people where we had also some great discussions about latin as a language in school and introducing agile techniques to teams in very big and long lasting projects. very interesting.know i am done, have a good night
