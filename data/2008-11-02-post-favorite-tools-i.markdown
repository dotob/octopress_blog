I know there are a lot of tools lists out there one of the the best i found for Windows based tools is the one of [scott hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/tools).  but because this one is very big and has a lot of tools in it and also lacks the mac os site of stuff i decided to compile my very little own tools list:
  #### file manager
  
windows: [total commander](http://www.ghisler.com) (26€)
  
most powerful two-pane-designed eplorer substitute i know. is around a long time now and still updated. with all the good stuff we loved in norton commander (which we called "the friend" back in the days). but here is what i like most:
     - obviously the two pane design
    - the focus on keyboard over mouse
    - instant search as you type like firefox (there are various other options to search the current filelist)
    - multiple tab support
    - syncronous navigation of the open panes (when developing software it is that you often have multiple nearly equal directory tree, open them both in one pane and navigate through them in sync, very nice)
    - the copy/move-queue (you can add to a queue when copying/moving files)
    - renaming assistant
   
mac os x: [pathfinder](http://www.cocoatech.com/) (40€)
  
a nice replacement for the finder. no comparison to total commander but ok. i like:
     - the drop stack where you can drop files and dirs
    - intergated terminal
    - integrated preview
   #### editor (usually for viewing only)
  
my normal editor for coding is the editor in my ide (visual studio or eclipse). but for viewing textfiles or searching/replacing in them i use:
  
windows: [notepad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/de/site.htm) (free, os)
     - fast
    - multiple opened files (can remember which files where open in last session)
    - can change encoding format
   
mac os x: [macvim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) (free, os)
  
mac os clone of the glorious loved/hated vim-editor. 
     - vim can do everything...
   #### image viewing
  
windows: [irfanview](http://www.irfanview.net/) (free)
     - fast
    - can make screenshots
    - nice printing
    - view exif data
    - crop images
   
mac os x: xee (free)
     - fast
    - very easy interface
   ##### image editing
  
windows: [paint.net](http://paint.net/) (free, os)
     - fast
    - supports layers
   
mac os x: [photoshop elements](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshopelmac/) (70€)
     - most features i used from photoshop i can use here
    - repair brush
    - scan ability
    - the legendary photoshup user interface
   
to bee continued...
